# @moeenn/recover
I dislike try-catch. The syntax is clunky and inconvenient. This library provides a somewhat similar approach to error handling as Golang. I believe error handling should be as convenient as possible so we as developers are more inclined to use it in more places in our code.


## Installation
```bash
$ npm i @moeenn/recover
```


## Usage
```ts
// TODO
```


## Running test
```bash
$ npm test
```
